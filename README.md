# Chapter 1, Day 1:
1. A Blockchain is an open, decentralized, public database which stores data into linked chunks (or, blocks) as opposed to your usual database which stores them in tables. The most common type of data stored on blockchains are ledgers for transactions, however other types may be used.
2. Smart Contracts are transaction protocols on the blockchain which execute terms of a contract. They are speedy,  extremely secure, and - for better or worse - irreversible once deployed.
3. Transactions are used to change blockchain data while Scripts are used merely to view blockchain data. 


# Chapter 1, Day 2:
The Pillars of Cadence programming language (& their usefulness!)

1. Safety and Security - self-explanatory; should be the hallmark of any smart contract language worth its muster!  
2. Clarity - code that is simple for developers to express intent and readers to comprehend serve to ensure safety 
3. Approachability - Similarities in syntax to other programming languages ensures a low barrier to entry for interested software developers.	
4. Developer Experience - clarity in error messages will help developers debug sans frustration. 
5. Resource Oriented Programming

## Quests

1. We wouldn’t call _changeGreeting_ in a script because scripts are meant to view data, and _changeGreeting_ is meant to modify data (more specifically, here: our _greeting_ variable)
2. In the _prepare_ phase of the transaction **AuthAccount** is meant to access the data in one’s account. 
3. In the _Prepare_ phase of a transaction, we are accessing data in someone’s account, while in the _Execute_ phase we are changing some data
